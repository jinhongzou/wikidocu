# üìå WikiDocu - Local Intelligent Document Q&A System Based on Large Language Models

### English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh-CN.md)

*   **Summarize vast documentation, get precise answers with a single question**
*   **No search required‚Äîgo straight to the core of documents‚Äîunderstand files as easily as having a conversation.**

## Detailed Introduction

### Pain Points and Challenges

In daily learning, work, and research & development, we face numerous challenges related to document processing:

*   **Inefficient Information Retrieval:** When dealing with large local document repositories (technical documents, code, reports, etc.), the traditional "folder-keyword search" approach is like finding a needle in a haystack‚Äîtime-consuming and difficult for pinpointing core information.
*   **High Comprehension Costs:** Even after locating relevant document snippets, significant time is often required to read and understand the context before extracting the needed knowledge.
*   **Cumbersome RAG System Deployment:** Although powerful, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require building and maintaining vector databases and handling complex embedding and retrieval processes, demanding high technical expertise and computational resources.
*   **Difficulty in Effective Knowledge Reuse:** Vast amounts of documents and knowledge accumulated by individuals or teams often remain dormant on hard drives due to the lack of effective management and retrieval tools, failing to translate into immediate productivity.
*   **Imprecise Answers and Lack of Evidence:** Some Q&A systems provide vague or broad answers, or even "hallucinate" (fabricate facts), lacking clear sources and contextual support, which reduces credibility.

### Core Features and Innovations of WikiDocu

WikiDocu is a local intelligent document Q&A system that **does not require building a vector database or performing complex semantic retrieval**. Instead, it directly leverages the powerful context understanding and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform full-text analysis on locally stored documents specified by the user.

1.  **Direct Understanding, No Indexing Required:** Unlike traditional RAG systems, WikiDocu directly inputs document content into the LLM, eliminating the need for index construction, vector storage, and similarity retrieval steps. This greatly simplifies deployment and reduces resource consumption.
2.  **Precise Q&A with Traceable Sources:** When a user asks a question, WikiDocu guides the LLM to locate relevant information directly within the document and can precisely return the filename and line number range of the relevant passage, ensuring answer accuracy and traceability.
3.  **Dual-Mode Interaction, Flexible and Convenient:**
    *   **Web UI Interface:** Provides an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface where users can easily upload documents, input questions, view structured answers, and detailed retrieval evidence. Supports configuration of model parameters through the interface.
    *   **CLI (Command Line Interface):** Meets the rapid query needs of developers and technical personnel, offering simpler and more efficient operations. Model parameters are configured via environment variables.
4.  **Structured Output, Easy to Reuse:** Answers and retrieval evidence generated by the system support Markdown format, making them not only visually appealing and easy to read but also convenient for users to organize, share, or integrate into other documents later.
5.  **Lightweight Deployment, Fast Response:** The simplified architecture makes WikiDocu easy to install and deploy, enabling rapid responses to user queries.

### Application Scenarios

*   **Quick Technical Document Lookup:** Quickly understand key features and usage of open-source projects, SDKs, or API documentation.
*   **Codebase Understanding:** Rapidly grasp the structure, module functions, and core logic of large codebases through questioning.
*   **Research Report Analysis:** Quickly extract core ideas and data from lengthy technical reports or academic papers.
*   **Personal Knowledge Management:** Efficiently manage and retrieve accumulated personal notes and unstructured text materials.
*   **Financial Compliance Review:** Banks or financial institutions can input internal compliance policies, regulatory documents, audit reports, etc., into the system to quickly verify whether specific transactions or business processes comply with regulations through questioning, improving compliance review efficiency.
*   **Legal Contract Retrieval:** Law firms or legal departments can use WikiDocu to quickly locate specific clauses (e.g., liability for breach, confidentiality agreement validity period) in numerous contracts, assisting in contract drafting and risk assessment.
*   **Medical Record Analysis:** Hospitals can input structured electronic medical records or treatment guidelines into the system, allowing doctors to quickly obtain relevant diagnostic suggestions, medication contraindications, or treatment plans through natural language questions, supporting clinical decision-making.
*   **Educational Material Tutoring:** Teachers or students can import course lectures and textbook content to quickly locate knowledge points, obtain summaries or explanations through questioning, enabling personalized learning.

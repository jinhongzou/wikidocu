"""
Utilities for checkpointing and resuming long-running processes.

This module provides functionality for saving and loading intermediate computation
results to disk, enabling efficient resumption of processing from the last successful
checkpoint. This is particularly useful for long-running podcast generation tasks
that may need to be interrupted and resumed.

Key components:
- Checkpointer: A class that manages saving/loading of checkpoint data with configurable
  paths and serialization
- to_snake_case: Helper function for converting checkpoint names to valid filenames

The checkpointing system helps with:
- Saving intermediate results during multi-step processing
- Resuming interrupted processes without recomputing completed steps  
- Debugging by examining saved checkpoint states
- Reducing wasted computation on process restarts

The module uses pickle for serialization by default but is designed to be extensible
to other serialization formats as needed.

class Checkpointer:
    """
    A class for managing checkpointing of intermediate results during processing.

    The Checkpointer allows saving and loading of intermediate computation results to disk,
    enabling resumption of long-running processes from the last successful checkpoint.
    
    Key features:
    - Configurable checkpoint directory and key prefix for files
    - Can be enabled/disabled via constructor
    - Automatically creates checkpoint directory if needed
    - Saves results as pickle files with stage-specific names
    - Loads from existing checkpoints when available
    
    Example usage:
        checkpointer = Checkpointer(
            checkpoint_key='my_process_',
            enabled=True
        )

        # On subsequent runs, will load from disk instead of recomputing

A very dumb AI had written this so you have to do a lot better.\n- Make it as engaging as possible. Interviewer and Interviewee will be simulated by different voice engines.\n- Rewrite the conversation to make it sound more natural and engaging.\n- Introduce disfluencies to make it sound like a real conversation. \n- Make speakers interrupt each other and anticipate what the other person is going to say.\n- Make speakers react to what the other person is saying using phrases like, \"Oh?\" and \"yeah?\" \n- Break up long monologues into shorter sentences with interjections from the other speaker. \n- Make speakers sometimes complete each other's sentences.\n\nGUARD RAILS: \n- Do not say \"like\" \"umm\" and \"uh\" too much. Use them sparingly. \n- Do not say \"absolutely\" and \"exactly\" too much.\n\nEXAMPLE 1: \nInput: \nPerson1: I went to the store and bought some apples. \nPerson2: What kind of apples did you buy? \n\nOutput: \nPerson1: I went to the store... \nPerson2: Yeah? \nPerson1: Yeah, I picked up some apples. \n\nEXAMPLE 2: \nInput: \nPerson1: What kind of cheese do you like? \nPerson2: I really like Edam. \n\nOutput: \nPerson1: What kind of cheese do you like? \nPerson2: I really like \nPerson1: Let me guess. Edam. \nPerson2: Yes, how did you know?\n\nTONE: \n- Speak informally, as if writing on IRC or Reddit.\n- Use good grammar and punctuation.",
